# Python-basic-advanced-Trainer
A simple project for offline training to learn Python from basic to advanced level.

Existing problems and shortcomings that will be solved in this version:

  ✅ Unused or unnecessary functions have been removed from the app.js file
  
  ✅ Show solution button added
  
  ✅ The logic for adding libraries is described in the app.js file
  
  ✅ The logic for placing all files from the shared folder into their directories
  
  ✅ The main libraries for offline work have been downloaded (65 in total, with dependencies)
  
  ✅ The following topics have been added for additional material
  
    decorators
    the most common libraries, what, why, how to connect, links to familiarize yourself with each of these libraries
    (including Tkinter, Beautiful Soup, Collections, random, Pandas and NumPy)
    working in Google Colab
    generators in Python
    working with network protocols, what it is for, what it is
    pros and cons of the Python programming language
    what projects are implemented in Python and what technologies it is related to
    what is the PEP-8 index, briefly what it is about, the most important thing from it. Links to read the full document
    examples of good naming, relationship of naming to PEP-8
    what is a multi-paradigm programming language
    what is functional programming
    what are iterators, generators, examples, what to use
    Python built-in functions (map, filter, enumerate, sorted, any, all and zip).
    how they work with iterators to improve code efficiency
    The path of code from the programmer's head to production
    Variables, references and RAM
    recursion, what it is, examples, what to use
    
  ✅ The following information materials have been added for additional material
  
    examples of using decorators from simple to complex, up to 5 examples
    examples of using generators from simple to complex, up to 5 examples
    examples of using iterators from simple to complex, up to 5 examples
    examples of good naming (taken from additional material)
    
  ✅ Sorted additional materials
  
  ✅ Sorted information materials
  
  ✅ Expanded the OOP topic: Classes and Objects:
  
    class definition syntax
    inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
    
  ✅ Added the following topics:
  
    set: types set, frozensent
    type NoneType
    
  ✅ Added sections for additional material, syntaxes with examples:
  
    class definition syntax
    class as a template for objects
    inheritance
    polymorphism
    encapsulation
    set: types set, frozensent
    type NoneType
    
  -X- "Sandbox", for a full-fledged test with all functions (input-output, file operations
  
    — Make a sandbox in this form:
    — make an empty task "Sandbox" in a separate JSON (without a topic), or at the end of the existing tasks.json
    — when selecting this task in the task block, the following will be added:
      a "Save code" button will be added
      an input field in the form of a line before the console
    — connect the logic when clicking the "Save" button, which will:
      write the code written in the "solution" field to a file
      and the input written from the input field to the "tests" -> "input" field: "here is the text entered from the input field",
    — when clicking the run code button of this "Sandbox", the code will be read from the file
      to execute the program, in case of testing your code, if there is multiple data, then through a comma
  — Adaptation to the mobile version
  
  — Check adaptations to different screen sizes
